Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke via video link on Tuesday, announcing a series of new, concrete initiatives based on China's firm determination and long-standing efforts in line with the mantra "Green mountains are gold mountains and silver mountains."
Among the significant actions, China will establish the Kunming Biodiversity Fund to support biodiversity protection in developing countries, taking the lead by investing 1.5 billion yuan (233 million U.S. dollars). China will move faster to establish a protected-areas system with national parks as the mainstay. The country will also put in place a "1+N" policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality.
These measures are encouraging news for the world amid efforts to improve biodiversity and environmental governance. They also reflect China's resolve to continue building an ecological civilization, as the country is now equipped with better resources to maintain the balance between the dual tasks of economic recovery and environmental protection.
