Need for awareness about another economic hardship, period poverty

A recent online campaign drew public attention to a poverty unique to women£­period poverty. Sanitary products, which every woman needs during her period, actually pose great economic hardships on quite a few women in China.
Some people argue that a sanitary pad costs 2 yuan ($0.291) at most, and the total monthly expenditure could come to a dozen yuan, which is not a lot. However, for those who say so the price of sanitary products every month is equivalent to what they spend on a cup of coffee. And they overlook the actual income situation of a large number of people in China.
