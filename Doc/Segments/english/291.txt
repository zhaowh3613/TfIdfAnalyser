Challenges remain but Hainan will deliver
A day before the third anniversary of the founding of Hainan Free Trade Port, the State Council Information Office on Tuesday said customs officials had busted 66 smuggling gangs that were handling about 200 million yuan ($30.52 million) of funds during 11 operations launched over the past two years.
As expressed at Tuesday's news briefing, Hainan has been taking measures to optimize its industrial structure for the past three years in order to achieve high-quality development. The idea behind the construction of the port is to make good use of the favorable national policies to realize high-quality development.
What the port has achieved in the past three years is there for all to see. There was a time when Hainan was blamed for relying too much on the realty sector and, not having much to show by way of industry.
