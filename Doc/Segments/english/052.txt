APEC is an economic forum in which the members come together to develop consensus on steps to advance open trade and regional economic integration, drawing on the expertise and experiences of the members. The steps agreed are expressed as voluntary, non-binding commitments in declarations by APEC ministers and economic leaders. The voluntary nature of APEC commitments is viewed by some observers as a weakness, and by others as a strength, in that it allows agreement to develop out of a free exchange of experiences, research findings, and priorities without the need for unproductive adversarial negotiations and legalistic dispute procedures. The commitments nevertheless emerge from processes of rigorous analysis and debate.
In earlier years the commitments were set out by members in Individual Action Plans, and progress toward implementing the Action Plans was regularly reviewed by APEC members. In more recent years the scope of these commitments have expanded to cover a wide range of issues embracing objectives relating to inclusiveness, sustainability and economic reform, addressed within APEC under its structural reform agenda. As with other members, it is likely that APEC work programmes on structural reform influenced processes of economic reform within China, in particular following its entry into the WTO.
The extensive networks developed through participation in APEC among ministers, officials, business leaders and academics are an important contribution toward institutionalising cooperation among APEC members.
