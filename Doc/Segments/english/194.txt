After the digital services tax is put into place, the Chinese technology companies will have to adopt more transparent accounting practices, and follow relevant rules. To tax digital businesses entails reliable accounting and real cost-profit calculations. That said, the pressure from the digital services tax, and its inherent needs for professional accounting services means Chinese companies will have to meet the international standards on accounting and transparency.
Also, by joining the global digital services tax initiative led by the European Union, China can continue to deepen its cooperation with the EU. So far, the disputes on the digital services tax center around the conflicts between the US companies and the EU. It is predictable that to levy the tax in the EU will take a certain period of time, which, particularly before the EU and the US reach an agreement on the tax, will provide China a window of opportunity to negotiate with the EU on it.
