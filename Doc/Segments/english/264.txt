Exports increased 38.7 percent in the first quarter. This is better than expected, showing the global recovery is gathering pace. The increasing external demand is likely to continue in the foreseeable future.
As such, consumption has contributed 11.6 percentage points of the 18.3 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, with investment and net exports contributing 4.5 percentage points and 2.2 percentage points respectively. It is projected that more than half of the economic growth will come from consumption this year. But although the role of investment will become smaller in boosting growth, it remains crucial as more money is flowing to high-tech industries and the service sector.
