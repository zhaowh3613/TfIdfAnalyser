However, the social factors behind the epidemic's second wave in Europe deserve our attention.
When the epidemic first broke out in Europe, most countries treated its prevention and control as an internal matter. The European Union later adopted a series of measures, such as border controls and material allocation, to promote anti-epidemic cooperation among member states.
However, the EU lacks enough power to frame legally binding regulations to promote such kind of cooperation. So, the epidemic is severely testing the EU's governance ability in the realm of public health.
