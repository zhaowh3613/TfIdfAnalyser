Since 2005, China has been adjusting pensions according to the rise in average wages and prices every year.
Given that there are a large number of insured people in China, a continuous rise in pensions puts more pressure on the fiscal budget. Latest data show that by March 2021, the number of people covered under basic old-age insurance nationwide had reached 1.007 billion.
Thanks to its rapid economic development for years, China's enterprise endowment insurance fund has accumulated a solid "wealth pool". According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, since the end of 2016, the State's pension fund has got a cumulative investment return of 200 billion yuan ($30.93 billion), with an average annual return rate of more than 6.8 percent. In 2020, the entrust investment of the basic pension insurance fund by 25 provincial-level regions reached more than 1.11 trillion yuan, with the investment yield rate exceeding 10 percent for many regions.
