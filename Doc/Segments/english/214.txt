The key to promoting Chinese brands lies in domestic enterprises and products themselves. To strengthen brand construction, build high-end brands, and advance from "made in China" to "created in China", domestic enterprises need to continuously promote scientific and technological innovation, facilitate the transformation and upgrading of the industrial structure, and improve China's industrial brands to graduate to the middle-and high-end of the global value chain.
Promoting Chinese brands requires domestic enterprises to assume social responsibility, inject social value, and help create a vision for a better life. To promote Chinese brands, domestic enterprises need to build brands that contain Chinese aesthetics and values, as the cultural connotation of a nation is an inexhaustible source of aesthetic creativity for brand construction.
To sharpen the edge of Chinese brands, lead consumption upgrading and share more Chinese brands with the world, domestic enterprises must depend on innovation, quality and responsibility to polish Chinese brands. The establishment of "China Brand Day" is just a starting point.
