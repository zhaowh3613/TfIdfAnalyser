The nuclear wastewater at Fukushima has to be treated by an Advanced Liquid Processing System before discharge. Japan developed an ALPS in 2012 to deal with the radioactive water after filtering out radioactive elements except tritium. According to the ALPS team's Feb 10, 2020, report, however, 73 percent of the processed nuclear wastewater had not met the standards till Dec 31, 2019.
Given the Tokyo Electric Power Company's record in falsifying data, one doubts if their processed water will be safe enough to be discharged into the sea.
It will be better if Japan chooses the best way of dealing with the contaminated water under the supervision of all parties concerned.
