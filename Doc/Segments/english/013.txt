One problem with this approach is that China is already ahead of Britain in these areas. The UK is under the nostalgic illusion that Brexit has somehow made it a great power again, when in fact the opposite is true.

In a second such meeting, Japanese and French foreign and defense ministers held virtual talks Thursday that focused on countering China's rise. These talks are the first since 2019, and could be seen as behind-the-scenes efforts to bring France back into the circle of "Indo-Pacific" warriors after a devastating diplomatic snub by Australia, the U.S. and Britain to France last year over a lucrative submarine contract.
The four ministers danced to America's tune by calling for a "free and open Indo-Pacific," a pet phrase favored by Washington.
