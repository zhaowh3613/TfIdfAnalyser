Facts speak louder than words. China has its own way of developing its economy and has amassed valuable experience over the years. If Western economic and political communities still attempt to read the Chinese economy without thinking outside the old box, or give up their prejudices, China's economy will continue to be a myth for them.
To grow its economy effectively, China has been able to keep consistency and adapt to changes.
While the world is undergoing transformations rarely seen in a century and wrestling with the COVID-19 pandemic at the same time, China has not only maintained its macro-economic policies steady, but also geared up to build a new development pattern and promote high-quality development.
As a result, China was the world's only major economy that registered a positive growth last year, and its economy expanded at 12.7 percent in the first half of this year. Those achievements have demonstrated the strong resilience of the Chinese economy and injected both confidence and impetus into the global economic recovery.
Moreover, China has been willing to use policy tools to push forward reforms, stimulate innovation and energize new development momentum.
