On the surface, this might seem like a victory for U.S. President Joe Biden's pledge to use alliances to unite what he calls "democracies" against "autocrats."
However, the limited scope, scale and ambition of these meetings show that the world is not ready to take sides in America's attempt to divide the world with a new Cold War.
In the first such meeting, UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss and Secretary of State for Defense Ben Wallace met Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne and Minister for Defense Peter Dutton to discuss security cooperation.
Truss has made it explicitly clear that the target of the meetings is China.
Australia is suffering a significant amount of economic pain from choosing an aggressive stance against China. Truss is trying to soothe the injuries by talking up future technology transfers and investment deals for Australia, not only in terms of nuclear submarine technology, but also in the high tech and space fields.
