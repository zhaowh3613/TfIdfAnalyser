Local residents do not benefit from such misdeeds. On the contrary, declining tourist numbers will mean lower income for many.
The law-abiding traders and residents living near tourist spots should not allow such scams to strike root in their midst as once tourists stop coming, they will all be left in the lurch. At the slightest suspicion, they should call the police and alert them about any illegal or suspicious activities, so that fewer tourists are cheated this way. It is time more residents came forward to save the local tourism industry.
