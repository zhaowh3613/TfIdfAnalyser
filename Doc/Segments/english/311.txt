People benefit from medical catalog adjustment
The National Healthcare Security Administration and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on Monday published a new catalog of medicines for basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance effective from March 1, lowering the prices of 119 medicines by more than half.
This sets a record in the number of medicines whose prices have been lowered. Another notable feature of the newly adjusted catalog is the significantly shorter time interval between adjustments. Since the formulation of the first list for the country's medical insurance drugs in 2000, adjustments were made in 2004, 2009, 2017 and 2019. The interval between this adjustment and the last one is just one year. The reason for this short interval is a document issued by the National Healthcare Security Administration on July 30 on medicines management for basic medical insurance, which stipulates that the country's administrative department for medical security will in principle establish and improve a dynamic adjustment mechanism, to be adjusted once a year.
