Over the course of China's economic take-off in recent decades, noises forecasting a collapse of China have hardly been absent. However, the Chinese economy continues to grow and improve, and its development achievements have been indisputably remarkable. Those who often spoke ill of the Chinese market were frequently slapped by reality.
