Can't force Huawei to be apple of one's eye
A company in Yancheng, Jiangsu province, reportedly introduced an internal document requiring all employees to stop using iPhones. Those who continue using iPhones could lose their jobs while those who switch to Huawei would get subsidies, the document said.
Asked why, a senior company executive said the move was to ensure the security of information and commercial secrets, and to encourage all to support domestic brands. Some enterprises and agencies might have security concerns, but for the company involved that seems unlikely, and it seems to be more of a publicity ploy.
There have been instances in the past, too, of other private companies forbidding employees from using iPhones and insisting they support Chinese brands.
