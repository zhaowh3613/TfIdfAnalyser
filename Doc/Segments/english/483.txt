Although menstruation is a biological phenomenon every woman experiences every month, it is seldom discussed openly because of our mindset. In the absence of necessary public attention and support, women have been silently suffering period poverty for long.
Making note of and admitting to a problem is the first step toward solving it. Similarly, eliminating period poverty will require comprehensive discussion and investigation, but it is good to see that the issue is finally being addressed and drawing public attention. Society should pay greater attention to the needs of impoverished women, particularly make basic sanitary products available to them.
