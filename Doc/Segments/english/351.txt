Rude behavior does not have a nationality
On Friday, when a Japanese brand launched its new clothing line, there was chaos at one of its branches in Nagoya. As some videos that went viral show, people did not stand in line, some glass panes were broken and shop windows vandalized.
Someone's comment on a social networking site, saying he thought this was happening in China before realizing it was in Japan, got the maximum likes. Others asked if some of those standing in line were foreign dealers buying in order to resell.
