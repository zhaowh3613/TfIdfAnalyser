To put it simply, some US politicians want to kill TikTok.
But by killing TikTok in the US a lot of Americans will lose their jobs. If TikTok is closed, 1,500 US jobs will be lost. Not to mention those who use the short video app to make a living.
US politicians should rethink their greedy appetite that hurts all, including US citizens.
