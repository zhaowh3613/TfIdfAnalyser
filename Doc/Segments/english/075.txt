More fundamentally, with an eye toward the future, China has been playing a constructive role in improving global economic governance.
In the face of rising trade protectionism, economic nationalism as well as unilateralism under the disguise of multilateralism, China has been trying to work with the wider world to promote true multilateralism by defending the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, and by championing ever deeper bilateral, multilateral and regional free trade.
Beijing has also supported necessary WTO reforms on topics like trade policy review and e-commerce, as well as an earlier settlement of the WTO's Appellate Body crisis.
Unfortunately, those contributions, in the eyes of Washington, are either ignored or twisted as serious threats to the United States and Beijing's "secret plans" to compete with Washington for global supremacy. They view the global economy as a you-win-I-lose game where the United States should always be on the winning side. No country, not even Washington's allies in Europe, is allowed to challenge America's economic predominance.
