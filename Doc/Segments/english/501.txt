Brand owners must keep tabs on franchises
The China Consumers Association held its annual meeting on Thursday, collectively reporting on the improper or illegal deeds of some enterprises. Burger King was among the enterprises reported this year.
According to news reports, a China Central Television reporter interviewed some employees at Burger King restaurants in Nanchang, capital city of Jiangxi province. In one of them, when the bread expired, the manager just ordered them to tear off the old data tags and put on new ones instead. The next day, the bread that had expired was sold to consumers.
