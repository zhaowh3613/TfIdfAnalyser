More teeth to check internet monopoly
The State Administration for Market Regulation recently introduced a draft guideline document to prevent internet platform-based economies from becoming monopolies, lower administrative law enforcement and compliance costs for market entities, improve antitrust regulations, advance fair market competition, protect consumer interests, and promote the sector's sustainable and healthy development.
The Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee said that China will build a high-standard market system, improve the fair competition system, and fully implement the negative list system for market access. It particularly emphasized that the country will implement the fair competition review system and enforce the anti-monopoly law.
