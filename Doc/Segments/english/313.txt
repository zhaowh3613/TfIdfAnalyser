With a faster adjustment pace, the catalog of insured drugs will no longer be a "safe box". In the past, many auxiliary drugs stayed on the list of insured medicines for a long time, making it difficult for many necessary and good clinical drugs urgently needed by patients to enter the list. However, after the dynamic adjustment of the list patients can stop "looking at drugs and feeling frustrated".
The dynamic catalog adjustment will also lead to rapid drug innovation and R&D by pharmaceutical companies, reduce doctors' concerns when prescribing drugs and rapidly improve medical insurance and people's welfare.
