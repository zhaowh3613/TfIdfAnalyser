In fact, in an age of economic globalization, countries worldwide are already knitted together by increasingly crisscross global industrial and supply chains. They provide one another with goods and services based on their comparative advantages. This nature of reciprocity, though disavowed by those zero-summers in the United States, is how the modern global economy works. In a long-term perspective, all economies win or lose together.
Today, the world economy is still struggling to recover in the throes of a still raging pandemic, surging inflation, chaotic supply chains and a lopsided global economic recovery. Solidarity and win-win cooperation are needed more than ever before.
"The WTO would not be the World Trade Organization without China," said WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. At a time of uncertainty, China bashers in the West should stop peddling irresponsible accusations against China and work with Beijing, because at the end of the day, no one alone can handle the sheer complexity and burden of rescuing the global economy.
