In order to ensure steady improvement in retirees' pension benefits, the country has accelerated the reform of the old-age insurance system. In July 2018, China established a central allocation system for old-age insurance funds and promoted the improvement of provincial pooling of old-age insurance.
At the same time, the Ministry of Finance is working with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security to formulate measures to support the development of other sources of old-age insurance, and comprehensively utilize tax incentives and other means to develop a multi-level and multi-source old-age insurance system and improve the old-age care level for insured people. This will help ease the country's pension payment pressures.
The rising pensions show the country wants everyone to share the fruits of economic development. With continuous economic development, pensions will continue to rise and the rights of retirees will be better protected.
