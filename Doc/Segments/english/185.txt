Scholz has not specified whether the objective of setting up such a club is to prompt the countries to reach consensus on green taxes to be levied on imported products or on the transactions of carbon quotas.
If it targets taxes on imported goods, the club will apparently not be a good choice for big goods traders, such as China and Germany. If it is about transactions of carbon emissions, the EU's carbon emissions trading system, the first multilateral one in the world, would undoubtedly serve as a model for the club. However, many problems with the EU carbon emissions trading system, such as insider dealing, that have remained untended for years deserve attention.
