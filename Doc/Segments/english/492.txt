The move found widespread support on social networking sites, as more people are waking up to the importance of getting rid of plastic garbage.
People who are accustomed to getting a plastic bag after buying goods in the supermarket will now have to look for degradable ones, if they are available.
Enterprises that produce non-degradable, disposable plastic bags will have to start producing degradable ones or go out of business. With less than half a year's time remaining before the non-degradable plastic bags are banned, local governments might need to help enterprises make the switch.
