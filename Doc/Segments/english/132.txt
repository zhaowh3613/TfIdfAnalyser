Before the launch of reform and opening-up, the floating population was regarded as a "problem". But over the past 40 years, with the continuous advancement of the country's urbanization policy, rural residents have migrated from the countryside to the cities for better paying jobs.
As a result, the policy relating to the floating population has become more inclusive, with local governments shifting from management of the floating population to providing them with services. According to the latest census, population mobility has become a prominent national phenomenon, and people should realize its significance, so as to make good use of the trend, and promote the common prosperity of urban and rural residents.
