Delivery workers for online orders take big slice of job pie
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security now recognizes the courier service for online orders, something that came into existence in recent years, as a profession.
The new profession has not only been growing rapidly in employment scale, but is also providing people bigger and better development opportunities, says a report issued by the ministry.
The profession is different from traditional deliverymen in that they provide spot-to-spot delivery for orders placed online.
