More policies are needed to encourage all couples to have two children.
First, the authorities need to lower the education and medical costs in metropolises, and social welfare measures must also be strengthened so more couples agree to have two children.
Second, education, medical care, housing, employment and eldercare departments must coordinate their policies to lower the cost of raising a child.
Third, senior citizens should not be treated as a burden, but as people who can still contribute to society. More measures are needed to support the eldercare sector, and infrastructure, public facilities and internet services must be improved to better serve the elderly. Besides, the "gray-hair economy" holds much potential that should be realized for the benefit of society.
