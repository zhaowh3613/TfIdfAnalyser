Fans of the celebrities were asked to scan a QR code hidden inside the dairy firm's milk bottles. That the QR code was valid for only three days prompted many fans to buy the milk bottles in bulk, open them to access the QR code and then dump the milk.
A video that has been widely circulated on social networking sites shows fans throwing away large quantities of milk after scanning the QR code.
The incident highlights the necessity of regulating the entertainment industry.
On April 29, the nation's top legislature passed the Law against Wasting Food, which the show's organizers might have violated.
They have set a bad example as wasting food is also against social mores and public ethics.
