Solidarity and partnership are important factors driving the progress of human society, and the UN was founded exactly to promote them. Since the establishment of the UN in 1945, the organization has been committed to the peace and development of the entire human rice and attached high importance to human rights, and thus grown into the most universal international organization in the world today.
To enhance multilateral cooperation is particularly important for the organization to stay true to its founding aspiration and cope with global challenges. China has always been a firm supporter and true follower of multilateralism, and actively conducted multilateral cooperation, which echoes with the spirit of the UN Charter and is of vital importance to solving global issues.
