China has made vital contribution to solving global issues
On Oct. 25, 1971, at its 26th session, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 that decided to restore all lawful rights of the People¡¯s Republic of China in the UN. It marked an important opportunity for the UN, the most universal international organization, to make further progress.
This historic moment came shortly after I started a career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, and this piece of big news impressed me very much. During the 10 years when I served as the UN Secretary-General, I had diverse communication and negotiation with China, which made me quite aware of the important role played by the country in the international society.
