The green tariffs are taxes levied on products from countries where the climate policies are looser so as to prevent these countries from taking advantage of a lower-price advantage to occupy the market by driving away products from those countries where strict green standards and climate policies of higher standards mean the prices of goods are higher.
This is undoubtedly a good intention. But many factors have to be taken into consideration. Different economies are in different development stages, and it is unrealistic for developing countries to implement green policies of the same standards as those in the developed economies. So the green tariffs are fundamentally in favor of developed economies, as they would be granted with a new channel to levy taxes on imports from less developed countries.
