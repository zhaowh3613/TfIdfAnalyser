Officials have stressed the goal of preventing not just infection but severe disease. On that count, the study also found a third dose was at least 90 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations for COVID-19, both during the Delta and Omicron periods.
The second study focused on COVID-19 cases and death rates in 25 states in the U.S. from the beginning of April through Christmas, 2021. People who were boosted had the highest protection against coronavirus infection, both during the time Delta was dominant and also when Omicron was taking over.
