It should be noted that the OECD's digital services tax mainly targets US companies that have enjoyed preferential tax rates in the developed countries for a long time. As the US companies will have to face a reduction in their profits in European countries, the Chinese technology companies might have more space in the European market.
China has been actively engaged in cooperation with the OECD and there is a possibility that China will take part in the digital services tax project as well so as to reduce the overseas tax burden on relevant Chinese companies and increase its own tax revenue from relevant foreign companies operating in China.
The large tax base provides China with bigger space to further lower its overall added value tax rate.
