But, more importantly, it has adjusted the electricity pricing mechanism by allowing the price to float within 20 percent rather than 10-15 percent. That has hit the nail on the head, because how to ensure residential use of electricity at acceptable prices while allowing coal-fired power plant operators to make money has long been a challenge. The electricity generating enterprises have long been required to keep their prices stable, but the coal used by power plants was purchased at market prices. When the price of coal rises, the coal electricity enterprises lose money for every kilowatt-hour of electricity they generate.
Also, while the nation is accelerating its carbon-cutting efforts by adjusting its industrial structure and shifting to greener development, some local governments have been going about it the wrong way, by allowing high carbon consumption in the first half of the year, then applying a sudden brake in the second half by limiting residential electricity use when they find it difficult to otherwise achieve their carbon-cutting objectives for the year. That's a big mistake that must be corrected. By highlighting the phenomenon and vowing to correct the wrong, the meeting offers hope that this issue will be resolved.
