People are willing to allow bio-data collection to ensure public security, but even so, the public security departments seem to be always on pins and needles whenever the public raises questions over their ability to protect data security after some incidents exposed loopholes in their management of people's data.
As the cases in Beijing and Zhejiang indicate, the "smart" trash cans are operated by the property management companies, rather the public security departments. So people have enough reasons to ask whether the property management companies have gone too far in using the technology to avoid littering, or broadly speaking, whether the use of facial recognition technology should be strictly controlled by the public security and industrial authorities.
The experience of some developed countries where domestic rubbish classification has been successfully implemented for years indicates it is not how smart the trash cans are that matters, but people's willingness to observe the rules.
