However, the country also needs a more systematic medium- and long-term plan for the floating population.
The authorities should systematically study major issues such as the distribution of the floating population and productive forces, and public services and fiscal and tax policies.
Public services should be further improved to increase the resilience of the cities that are seeing a large influx of migrant workers, while the construction scale and other aspects in cities with population outflows should be adjusted to improve the efficiency of resource utilization.
The population policy should involve efficient transfer and sharing of public services between cities. In recent years, most city governments have realized that the floating population helps better develop cities and try every means to retain them.
As such, cities with huge floating populations should be given reasonable authorization and policy space to provide better infrastructure and public services to the floating populations.
