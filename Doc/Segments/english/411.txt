Rewarding welcome at gates of independence
As the new academic year begins, freshmen are entering college campuses across the country, many of them accompanied by their parents or well-wishers. Xidian University in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, has introduced a policy that has caught everyone's attention. It will give away a "Freshman Independence Award" to those who come to college alone, not accompanied by parents. Awardees will receive a certificate, a specially designed T-shirt, and a photograph of them entering the campus taken for memory.
That's a very innovative idea and will encourage the young to be bold enough to travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers on their own to reach their new college. After all being independent is an essential part of growing up.
