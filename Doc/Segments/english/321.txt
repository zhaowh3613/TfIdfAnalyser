Country's manufacturing industry needs a boost and quality check
The Chinese Academy of Engineering's report on the state of the manufacturing industry says China is far from becoming an advanced manufacturing hub.
The report points out that the United States, Germany and Japan are the most developed countries in this field, and the gap with China remains wide.
The report says China is indispensable to the world's manufacturing supply chains not because of its technological strengths, but the scale of its manufacturing sector. The productivity and per capita output of China's manufacturing industry lag far behind those of the developed countries.
