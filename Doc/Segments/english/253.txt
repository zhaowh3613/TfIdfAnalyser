Second, there are different kinds of radioactive elements. The radioactive water at Fukushima has several kinds of radioactive elements, including some fission nuclides with long half-life periods, and some highly poisonous transuranium elements such as plutonium and americium. In contrast, the waste at functioning nuclear power plants does not directly come in contact with the nuclear reactor core, so it contains few fission nuclides and almost no transuranium.
