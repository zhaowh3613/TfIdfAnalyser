China is working to cope with the common challenges facing the international society, and it deserves high evaluation in this regard. The COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that we humanity can either rise together or fall apart depending upon our strong conviction on the concept of shared future. Therefore, to defeat difficulties, we must take the sharp weapon of solidarity and cooperation. China's role and contribution are obvious to all.
In the past 50 years since China restored its lawful seat in the UN, it has always upheld the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. As a founding member of the UN and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has made important contributions in a wide range of areas such as maintaining world peace and stability and promoting global development. The country will play a bigger role in the UN, and I¡¯m sure about that.
