China has hosted APEC twice: in 2001 under the theme of ¡°Meeting New Challenges in the New Century: Achieving Common Prosperity through Participation and Cooperation¡± and in 2014 under the theme of ¡°Shaping the Future Through Asia-Pacific Partnership¡±.
China¡¯s hosting of APEC in 2014 was particularly important in APEC¡¯s evolution. By this time China was clearly established as one of the world¡¯s two leading economies. It prioritised the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP), and secured the commitment of APEC Leaders to the Beijing Roadmap for APEC¡¯s contribution to the realisation of the FTAAP. An important first step along the Roadmap was a Collective Strategic Study jointly chaired by China and the United States, on the issues to be addressed in working toward establishment of the FTAAP. The insistence of APEC members that the study should be jointly chaired by China and the United States clearly reflected an understanding that the coming together of China and the United States in a consensus on how to proceed would be essential to the successful establishment of the FTAAP.
It is clear that the view that cooperation between the China and the United States is vital for APEC¡¯s success remains widespread among APEC members.
