In the past few years many migrant workers and non-urban residents have been floating between the urban and rural areas of China without a hukou. From the replacement of temporary residence permits with residence permits, to the continuous easing of the hukou threshold in most cities, from the point-based hukou acquisition in megacities to the latest easing of hukou restrictions, it is not difficult to see that the country has, in recent years, been reforming the household registration system in a steady manner.
According to the notice, the new policy should be applied equally to home renters and buyers, a substantial step toward implementing the undifferentiated "people-oriented" concept. This is clearly a milestone in the history of China's hukou reform, which means that in the vast majority of Chinese cities, hukou will no longer restrict free movement of people.
