Jiang might face criminal charges. According to a news release, Jiang's cartoons promote not just obscenity, but also inhuman practices such as infanticide. Some micro-bloggers complained that Jiang's cartoon strips showcased sex slaves, similar to the "comfort women" that the Japanese army forced many women to become before and during World War II, and promoted pedophilia and infanticide.
Jiang's cartoons violate the law against obscenity, belittle and offend women, and glorify the inhuman practices of a fascist regime. Jiang has been making and selling such cartoons since 2016 and he told the police that he has earned 1.2 million yuan ($183,734) through his cartoons.
Some micro-bloggers said he had half a million readers online. What is a matter of serious concern is that many of those readers could be youths, even minors, who cannot distinguish right from wrong and might end up committing the crimes Jiang's cartoons seem to promote.
