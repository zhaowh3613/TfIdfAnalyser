Given that EU countries have frequent economic and trade exchanges, border closures can effectively control the epidemic's spread, but they also make their economic recovery more difficult. As a result, some countries have vacillated between controlling the epidemic and promoting economic recovery. They opened their borders and consumption places to guests to promote economic recovery, leading to the number of infections surging, setting the stage for a resurgence of COVID-19 across the continent.
Since the spring, EU member states have adopted stricter measures, such as social distancing and the wearing of face masks. However, these measures have not been implemented properly, as some people believe these measures limit their "personal freedom". This, together with the economic contraction caused by the epidemic, has brewed discontent among many people and even sparked demonstrations in some countries.
Europe is facing a difficult choice between implementing lockdowns or not.
