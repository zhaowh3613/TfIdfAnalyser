The Anti-Monopoly Law came into effect in 2008, but in the past decade, leading market players in the internet sector have abused their dominant market positions. In recent years, legislators, experts and the media have called for investigations into such practices and for implementing anti-monopoly regulations.
With China becoming the second largest internet power, after the United States, a variety of new business models have emerged. However, with the continuous expansion of scale, some internet enterprises have gradually lost the internet spirit, giving rise to malpractices such as disorderly competition, false marketing and personal information leakages. All these are damaging to users, thus underlining the need for enforcing anti-monopoly laws.
