At a time when the United States government is forcing US companies to stop doing business with Huawei, it is good to see Chinese compatriots supporting Chinese brands. However, it isn't Apple that is stopping supplying chips and other high-tech parts to Huawei. It is US politicians. The president has also issued executive orders to shut down TikTok so as to force it to sell its US businesses to an American company.
The best way to support Chinese companies is to speak out against those US politicians. It is advisable, for example, to create awareness among friends in the US about the ways in which these politicians are harming both Chinese and US interests.
