Bidding goodbye to white pollution
The National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and seven other ministries jointly introduced a guiding document, according to which non-degradable plastic bags will be banned in a majority of cities from Jan 1, 2021.
All supermarkets and stores are required to charge customers for plastic bags, but the latest move shows the authorities' determination to reduce white pollution by putting an end to the use of plastic bags altogether.
