Led by CDC researchers, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the third study that looked at people who tested positive for COVID-19 from December 10 to January 1 at more than 4,600 testing sites across the U.S.
It found that three shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were about 67 percent effective against Omicron-related symptomatic disease compared with unvaccinated people. Two doses, however, offered no significant protection against Omicron when measured several months after completion of the original series.
"It really shows the importance of getting a booster dose," said the CDC's Emma Accorsi, one of the study's authors.
As of now, millions of Americans who are eligible have not gotten a booster shot.
"If you are eligible for a booster and you haven't gotten it, you are not up to date and you need to get your booster," CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a White House briefing Friday.
