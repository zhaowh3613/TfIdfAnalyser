China's own development itself has been a huge contribution, having contributed almost 30 percent on average each year to global economic growth for several consecutive years.
Furthermore, China's advantages in skilled labor, infrastructure and manufacturing systems have enabled the country to make quality goods at relatively low prices. In some sense, the American way of life is made in China.
