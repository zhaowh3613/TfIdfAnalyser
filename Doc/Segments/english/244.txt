Moreover, the current labor mobility in China is also due to the reshaping of manufacturing. For example, with the further use of mechanization and intelligence-based technologies, the manufacturing industry is gradually transforming from labor-intensive to capital-intensive, thus it has a declining demand for ordinary workers and offers decreasing remuneration for them.
The industrial transfer of labor forces is a normal phenomenon and should not be over-interpreted. The higher payment internet services can offer employees has attracted a large army of workers and also led to certain distortions in the current labor market.
However, the low employment threshold of internet-based services have also possibly increased people's unwillingness to increase professional skills in the short term, thus exacerbating the shortage of skilled workers in society.
