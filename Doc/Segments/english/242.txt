This is not an isolated phenomenon. In recent years, the number of workers engaged in internet-related jobs such as online ride-hailing drivers and delivery riders has increased year by year.
According to statistics, in 2019, among the 4 million riders for one food delivery platform, riders under the age of 40 accounted for 83.7 percent. In comparison, from 2008 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of migrant workers engaged in manufacturing was minus 2.84 percent.
This has prompted some people to ask whether China's manufacturing is on the decline.
