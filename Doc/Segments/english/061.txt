China takes concrete actions towards tackling climate change
China¡¯s active response towards tackling climate change provides robust evidence to refute US President Biden¡¯s remarks at COP26 that China just "walked away" and it is "a gigantic issue".
China has implemented a national strategy of actively responding to climate change. Compared with developed countries, which generally have set a timeframe of 40 to 70 years before shifting from carbon peaking to carbon neutrality, China, the largest developing country in the world, made a solemn promise to peak its carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This means that China will complete the world¡¯s largest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions intensity in the shortest time ever in global history.
China has announced a series of targets for nationally determined contributions and concrete policies and measures, setting out timetables, roadmaps and blueprints, issuing master plans, and setting clear objectives for each stage. China has put forward 10 major actions for peaking carbon dioxide emissions and has moved faster to put in place a ¡°1+N¡± policy framework for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.
