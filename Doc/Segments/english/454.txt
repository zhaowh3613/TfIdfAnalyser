The draft also stipulates that nonresidential spaces such as basement, kitchen, balcony and toilet cannot be leased out as residential spaces. House owners or enterprises that violate this regulation will be punished, according to the draft.
The draft also tries to balance the rights and interests of leasers and tenants. It stipulates that during the period of leasing, the leaser or tenant cannot unilaterally terminate the deal or raise/decrease rent, unless otherwise stated in the contract. Also, the leaser should not force a tenant to vacate the leased house.
The housing rental market's healthy and stable development is good for not only leasers and tenants but also the stability of society. All relevant parties should take the opportunity to submit their suggestion on the draft to the ministry to enable it to better play its intended roles.
