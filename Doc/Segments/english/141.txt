Difficult double duty needs to be done well
At an executive meeting of the State Council, China's Cabinet, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Friday, it was stressed that the price mechanism for coal-fueled electricity needs to be improved so it can better reflect market needs.
The meeting has timely responded to the public's concerns about power shortages after some cities limited or even cut off residential electricity supplies at times.
There were two main reasons for this: First, there has been a shortage of coal for electricity generation, which pushed up the price. Second, some local governments limited the electricity supply in order to meet their carbon emissions reduction targets.
