Improving the affordable-to-all childcare service system will help create a suitable environment for women wanting to bear children. The document issued by the three departments proposes to build a number of public childcare service institutions, expand the supply of childcare services, and support enterprises, public institutions and other social forces to set up childcare services institutions.
The government should consider providing childcare services as its responsibility and increase financial investment in this area. At the same time, it needs to increase policy input, provide policy support for nongovernmental organizations and other social groups to run childcare services, for example by reducing fees and offering free training for practitioners.
The relevant departments should also speed up the introduction of relevant policies, regulations and standards and norms to ensure the healthy development of the childcare service industry. For example, it is necessary to include childcare talents into the education support training system, promote the training of teachers in the childcare service industry and accelerate the training of professionals to improve the professional level of childcare services.
