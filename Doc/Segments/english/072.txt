It is true that China's economic miracle in recent decades has been closely connected with its WTO membership. Inflows of foreign capital, technologies and modern management practices, coupled with the hard-working spirit of the Chinese people, have co-authored China's economic leap. In 20 years, China's economy has grown from the sixth to the second largest in the world, its trade in goods from the sixth to the first, and trade in services from the 11th to the second.
But China is neither the biggest nor the only beneficiary. As a study published in 2019 by German think-tank the Bertelsmann Stiftung concluded, the United States benefits the most worldwide from its own WTO membership, having achieved the largest amount of income gains of some 87 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 alone.
