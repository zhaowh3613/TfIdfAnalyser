 China a major global growth driver, not free rider

In its latest round of China-bashing, the United States has colluded with some of its allies to blast China's economic policies and performance over the past 20 years at a recent closed-door World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting.
The flimsy accusations were nothing new. Ever since China's accession to the WTO, the United States has been relentlessly trying to inflate the fallacy that China has been a "free rider" in the world economy. In recent years, these ill-intentioned allegations seem to be on the rise in tandem with the steady growth of the Chinese economy.
As a matter of fact, the "free rider" myth has unmistakably exposed Washington's self-centrism and double standards in global economic activities.
