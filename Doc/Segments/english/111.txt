High time to protect biodiversity
As species worldwide continue to become extinct at an alarming rate, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation pose a major risk to human survival and development. It is high time for the international community to join hands to protect their common future.
As was underscored by the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, "Our two-century-long experiment with burning fossil fuels, destroying forests, wilderness and oceans, and degrading the land, has caused a biosphere catastrophe."
A key UN conference kicked off this week in southwest China's Kunming to discuss a blueprint for biodiversity conservation over the next decade. Themed "Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth," it is the first global conference convened by the UN to highlight ecological civilization, a philosophy proposed by China.
