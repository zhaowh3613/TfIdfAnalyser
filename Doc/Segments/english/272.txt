The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China had listed raising the middle-income group as one of its strategic objectives. China has the largest middle-income group, which plays a vital role in transforming the economy from an investment-driven to a consumption-driven one. Because of the important role the middle-income group plays, it is necessary to enhance its consumption abilities and prevent debt risks.
Several measures need to be taken. First, the incomes of lower income groups need to be raised. Compared with middle income groups, lower income groups are more likely to deposit money in banks. Increasing their numbers will, therefore, boost the total deposit rate. It will also help lower income people become middle incomers soon.
A large portion of lower income people, namely migrant workers, have agricultural land in their hometowns but work in the cities for better incomes. It is necessary to reform the housing registration, or hukou, system, to enable them to enjoy the welfare measures their urban counterparts enjoy.
