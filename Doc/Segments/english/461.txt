Data advantages can boost country's competitiveness
The more the United States strives to enforce a "digital hegemony" in cyberspace£­with its smash-and-grab of ByteDance's TikTok US operations as a case in point£­the more China should try to accelerate the development of its digital economy. Not only to entrench its status as a growth engine, but also to enable the country to better protect its "digital sovereignty".
Like it or not, data is becoming a core production element and fundamental resource in human society, making it a strategic property that all countries struggle for. That's why cyberspace and data are now regarded as new focuses of international geopolitical competition.
