Many localities and departments have established various data and information platforms, but due to administrative barriers and other problems, most of them are isolated and not used for data sharing. This has not only increased the work for departments at various levels and wasted governance resources, but also intensified the information asymmetry between higher and lower levels of governments and different departments, thus affecting the accuracy and precision of data on the poverty alleviation achievements.
This highlights the need for the country to facilitate the sharing of data to fully realize the potential of big data in consolidating the achievements of poverty alleviation. Local governments should collect the relevant data and information from different departments and build large databases of consolidated poverty alleviation data in provincial-level administrative regions.
In this process, the key is unified planning and unified standards so as to enable cross-regional and cross-departmental information exchanges.
