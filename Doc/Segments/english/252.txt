First, the source and scale of nuclear waste are different. According to the International Nuclear Event Scale, the Fukushima nuclear accident£­a meltdown after an earthquake-triggered tsunami hit the planet in 2011£­is a level seven (highest) nuclear accident in which large quantities of radioactive substances were released. The radioactive water stored in steel tanks is the water that was pumped into the plant to cool the damaged reactor as well as the underground water and rainwater that seeped into it.
In contrast, wastewater at other nuclear power plants comes from drainage and daily activities there.
