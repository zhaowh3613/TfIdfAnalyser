In the past, government agencies, hospitals, schools, and State-owned enterprises built a large number of nurseries, but with the reform of State-owned enterprises and other policies in the 1990s, these affiliated nurseries were shut down; even the rural and neighborhood ones no longer exist. Childcare services across the country are in a nascent stage and in short supply.
In particular, public nurseries and kindergartens are in serious short supply, while private ones charge high fees, imposing a heavy financial burden on ordinary families.
With more women deciding to work, the demand for childcare services is increasing. This too is casting a shadow on women's career development or their willingness to bear children.
