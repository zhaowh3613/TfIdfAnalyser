Blame illegal traders, not locals
Dunhuang is a scenic spot in Northwest China's Gansu province, well-known for its Mogao Grottoes featuring murals and sculptures among other things, some more than 1,000 years old.
However, on Monday the place was in the news for something else, something less savory. Media reports said that some people put up a "public toilet" signboard on the way to Dunhuang, making those wanting to relieve themselves take a detour off the main road, the terrain changed. The motorists hit a pile of sand where their vehicles got trapped. Soon they came face to face with those who had laid the trap, able-bodied men ready to pull their vehicle out of the mess for a price.
