Because of rising demand, especially after the novel coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of this year, the sector absorbed a huge number of laborers in a very short time. According to the ministry, there are several million delivery workers in the online e-commerce service sector in China.
In the first half of this year, around 3 million registered delivery workers received orders from meituan.com, a major online food delivery and ticketing services platform. The report estimated that the new sector will altogether employ 30 million people in the next five years.
