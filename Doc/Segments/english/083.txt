As early as 2019, Hainan province announced its ambitious plan of building an international e-sports center. On Nov 5, the Organizing Committee of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou city, East China's Zhejiang province, announced it had listed eight e-sports as events in the Games. Both of these show the strong policy support being given to e-sports.
With more Chinese star gaming clubs and teams emerging, the industry is expected to further prosper and continue spreading Chinese culture to the world.
