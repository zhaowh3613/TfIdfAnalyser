China in APEC: A view from New Zealand
China joined APEC in 1991, at the same time as Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong, China. The inclusion of China, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong, China as separate members of APEC, while maintaining adherence to the ¡°One China¡± principle, has been a learning experience for all APEC members. Recognition of the ¡°One China¡± principle is reflected in certain protocols that are observed within APEC for this purpose.
China¡¯s membership of APEC played a part in facilitating its entry into the newly-established WTO. As APEC members began to implement their Bogor Goals commitments from the mid-1990s China made some significant tariff reductions that were understood within APEC as a ¡°down payment¡± on its eventual commitments as a WTO member.
