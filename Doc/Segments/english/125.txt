In this highly inter-connected world, China believes playing the "zero-sum game" is not in the fundamental interests of the global community. Beijing has all along been firmly dedicated to opening-up and cooperation, and has always been trying to promote its own development by boosting the world's common development.
Despite that the economic globalization has been under fire, China, with even stronger commitment to opening-up, has continued to join others around the world to build an open global economy.
It has implemented the Foreign Investment Law, further opened up its financial sector in an orderly fashion, and set up platforms like the China International Import Expo and the China International Fair for Trade in Services to share with the wider world its development opportunities.
